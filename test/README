Testing
=======

To do the testing, create a webserver with coronis-test, and point the browser to [coronis-test]/test/index.html.

One very easy way to do it is:

.../coronis-test/$ busybox httpd -f -p 8080 . 

And you have your webserver at http://localhost:8080/test/

Individual tests can be run accessing to http://localhost:8080/test/01-step/ ...
