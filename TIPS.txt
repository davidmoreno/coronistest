Tips for tests that should pass but do not
==========================================

Some tips about extrange things that happend sometimes and are not the fault of the coronis tester, as they are
real 'errors', but not easy to discover, on the tested source.


Unexpected alerts
-----------------

Many AJAX request fail with an alert if htere is a failure. But loading a page that has ajax content and do not
let it gather it before going to the next page is also an error condition.


Firefox requesting send again data when clicking a link after a POST
--------------------------------------------------------------------

It is because you are getting next data with a location.href.reload() or something similar. It really reloads and
firefox advises it when its javascript triggered (vs human triggered). Better a location.assign(location.href).

Apearing prompt on test like:

	click('link=Edit')
	nextConfirm(true)
	click('[value=Remove Entity]')
	waitConfirm()
	errorOnNext()
	checkText('userB')

The fix is just dont do the nextConfirm until the edit page is loaded:

	click('link=Edit',true)
