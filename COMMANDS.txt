Introduction
============

Whenever the work *element* apears it means a locator. The locators can be jQuery 
expresions and the following keywords:

* link=TEXT   -- The link with that text
* option=TEXT -- The option with that text

Also there is support for varibale expansions on every text, using ${variable_name}. For example:

concat("hello","world")
type("input","hello ${hello}")

These are the commands available for ctest:

check(element)
--------------

Checks a checkbox. See uncheck()

checkAttr(element, attribute, value)
------------------------------------

If value is given checks its equal to attribute value. If not it checks the attribute exists.

In any case it returns into 'lasttext' the value of the attribute.


checkElement(element)
---------------------

Checks that the given element exists. As a side effect it copies the text of such element
to the 'lasttext' variable.

checkText(text,element)
-----------------------

Checks that the given text exists. If element is provided it checks only in that element.

click(element [,waitLoad])
--------------------------

Clicks on an element so as if the user had clicked with the mouse. Usefull to follow 
links, press buttons, activate javascript onlick (or event driven) signals...

Optional waitload inserts a wait load after clicking. Useful on some scenarios where next
actions can be applied both on old page and new, so waiting is highly recomended.

concat(varname, txt1, txt2, txt3, txt4)
---------------------------------------

Concats the txts, and sets the variable varname with such value.


drag(element, dx, dy) || drag(element, dest_element)
----------------------------------------------------

drags and drops an element to a delta place, if dx and dy is provided, or over another 
dest_element, if no 3rd argument is passed.


eval(javascriptcode)
--------------------

Evals some javascript code. It also has the long form ofseverl lines:

javascript{
 ...
}

load(testfile)
--------------

Loads another test file, relative to current, and executes it.

log(txt)
--------

Logs something on the ctest console.

errorOnNext()
-------------

An error is expected on next command. If it succeeds then it fails, and if 
it fails it succeed. Usefull for example to check if some text is not present.

nextAlert()
-----------

Prepares the system to receive just one alert soon. This is necesary for when there 
is an alert and then it loads a page. In such case there is the race condition 
that the page is loaded before or after the "waitAlert()" is there. If it loads
after, then no problem. If it loads before then the ctest fails as there was an
unexepected alert, unless you are expecting it. 

nextConfirm(bool)
----------------

Returns the given value to the next confirmation that appears. Remember that
it must be matched with a waitConfirm() to avoid the error of not aknowledging it.

nextPrompt(bool)
----------------

Returns the given value to the next prompt that appears. Remember that
it must be matched with a waitPrompt() to avoid the error of not aknowledging it.

mark(element)
-------------

Just changes the background to yellow. Usefull when debugging to look for elements, and also to
check which one was specifically addressed.

open(url)
---------

Opens the given url. It implies the waitLoad().

select(element, option)
-----------------------

Selects an option at the given select element.

set(variable, element, atribute)
--------------------------------

Sets to the internal variable *variable* the content of the attribute of the given element.
If no attribute is passed, it is copied the text.

setAttr(element, attribute, value)
------------------------------------

Sets the value at the attribute of the given element.

regexp(variable, original, regexp)
----------------------------------

Performs a regexp regular expression search on an original text, and stores the first group found
at variable.

uncheck(element)
----------------

Unchecks a checkbox. See check().

waitAlert(regexp)
-----------------

Waits for an alert to appear, if regexp is provided, it checks it complies to it.

waitConfirm(regexp)
-----------------

Waits for a confirmation to appear, if regexp is provided, it checks it complies to it.

waitLoad()
----------

Waits until a new page is loaded

waitPrompt(regexp)
-----------------

Waits for an prompt to appear, if regexp is provided, it checks it complies to it.
